We're excited to officially launch Lace Up for Kids!

We're a teen-led nonprofit based in Guilford, Connecticut, on a mission to transform gently used shoes into meaningful support for families staying at Ronald McDonald House of Connecticut and Massachusetts.

Here's how it works:
• We collect gently used shoes from our community that would otherwise end up in landfills
• Partner organizations purchase our collected shoes, generating funds for our cause
• 100% of net proceeds go directly to RMH CTMA to help families in need

Since starting, we've already collected 68 pairs of shoes—and we're just getting started!

Our team of passionate high school students is committed to making a real difference in our community while promoting sustainability and reducing waste. We believe that small actions can create big change, and by working together, we can support families facing difficult times.

Want to get involved?
• Drop off your gently used shoes at one of our collection boxes in Guilford, CT
• Follow our page for updates on events and impact
• Share this post to help us reach more families who need support

Together, we're turning sneakers into support, one pair at a time.
